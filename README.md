# Local Jupyter notebook

Execute following commamd:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

This will take a bit of time to pull jupyter image, then prompts a web link like this:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=$SOME_TOKEN_GIBBERISH
```

Open this link in browser, use `victor.ipynb` as an example notebook that imports modules.

Go on and solve the challenge!
